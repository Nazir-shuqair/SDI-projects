    <h2>Project 3</h2>

<article>
<p>The theme of this project is a mission plan for a tank assault.  Iâ€™ve been reading some military
 books lately and thought a mission like this would meet the requirement for this project.  
 The plan talks about an assault mission that needs to be carried out in order to control the region.
 This project relays the transcript of the mission discussion. </p>
